Oil production company needs to make a decision on the regiion where to drill a new well. The characteristics of oil samples for the oil deposits have been collected, e.i. the quality of oil and the reserves in some deposits in the three regions under consideration. 

### Solution
- Build a machine learning model to predict the reserves in a given oil deposit/well. 
- Use Bootstrap to estimate the risk of losses and potential profit in each region under consideration.
- Choose region based on the risk appetite of the client.
