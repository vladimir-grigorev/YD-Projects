# YD-Projects

Hey there,

if you are here, you are either an HR-manager, a good friend of mine, or Vik L. who is both. 
You are welcome here anyways!

This repository is a portfolio of projects accomplished within the 8-month course in Data Science offered by Russian Big Tech *Yandex*.

The portfolio intends to demostrate three things:
1. Coding experience covering several topics - from Exploratory Data Analysis to building Machine Learning models
2. Cleanliness and transparency of code writing
3. Aspiration for solving problems with Data

Each of the folders in this repository contains a Jupyter Notebook correspoding to a particular project. 
A little disclaimer: *Unfortunately, the data behind the projects can't be shared publicly. Hence, the scripts only display the work performed on those.*
However, you should be still able to see all the problems and solutions whithin the notebooks.

Thank you very much for visiting the page and enjoy the reading!

*YD stands for Yandex Practicum, company name offering the courses
